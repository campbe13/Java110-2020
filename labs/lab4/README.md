## do not use caps to begin vars
There is a defacto coding standard to use caps to begin class names.
```java
int perimeter;   // not int Perimeter;
```
## use meaningful variable names
This depends on context the name should be a noun that reflects what you will store in it.
```java
int area;    // not int number;
```
## printing with vars & strings
You can concatenate ```string + ``` strings & variables, there is implicit (automatic) conversion of numeric values to string.
```java
System.out.println("this is a string " + perimeter + "another string " + area + "yet another ");
```
