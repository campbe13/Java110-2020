# The following are for printing stars
see also [Lectur16algorithmStarsWhile.md](../Lectur16algorithmStarsWhile.md)
* print stars n times (inner loop only, for & while)
    * [code](Lecture16Stars.java)

we did the flowchart below during lecture 16 & the code will be done in lecture 17

	* [starter code](starter/) if you want to try it yourself.
    * [completed](completed/) for my solution
Print n stars m times, ex n=5 m=3
